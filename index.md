As the sole person in charge of this project, I have taken on a significant amount of responsibility regarding data management. I understand that proper data management is crucial to the success of my research and the impact it can have in the future. Therefore, I have identified several key roles that must be accomplished to ensure that my data is well managed.
Firstly, I am responsible for the implementation of the Data Management Plan (DMP). I have put in place measures to organize and safeguard the data throughout the project's duration. Secondly, I am responsible for data collection and generation, which includes the calibration of the instruments, the collection of data using LabView software, and the production of a dataset for each test. Thirdly, I am responsible for data organization, including maintaining proper file naming conventions and documentation to ensure easy and efficient retrieval of the data.
Furthermore, I am responsible for quality control, which involves checking data for accuracy, completeness, and consistency to ensure that it meets the required standards. I am also responsible for metadata generation, which involves the documentation of the data attributes and characteristics to ensure that the data can be understood and reused in the future.
Regarding contingency plans, I have established a Google Drive folder to store all the data collected in this project. This folder will be accessible to any relevant parties who may need to take over my research. It will contain all CAD files, Matlab codes, test data, personal notes, and everything related to the project. With this contingency plan in place, I am confident that the data will be well-managed and accessible even if I leave the project.
None of the data collected in this project is sensitive or confidential according to Oregon State University's definition. It does not include any personal information and does not require special protection measures.
Currently, I store my data on a portable Solid State Drive that I carry with me. However, at the end of the project, I will transfer all the data to Google Drive, which will provide a secure and reliable storage solution. I will have several copies of the data stored in different locations, including a cloud-based backup, and will ensure that the backup process is automatic and regularly updated. In addition, I will make sure that the shared network drive used to store the data is backed up regularly.
In conclusion, I recognize the importance of proper data management in research and have taken full responsibility for it. By following the plan I have set out, I am confident that the data collected in this project will be well-managed, easily accessible, and preserved for future use.
